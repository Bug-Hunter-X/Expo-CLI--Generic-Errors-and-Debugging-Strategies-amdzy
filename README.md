# Expo CLI: Uncommon Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates common scenarios where Expo CLI might produce generic error messages, along with troubleshooting steps and solutions.

The problem is that Expo sometimes gives cryptic error messages.  This repo aims to illustrate a few possible causes of unexpected CLI errors and show how to solve them.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified example of a project setup that might lead to this issue.  This involves using a package in `package.json` that is then improperly configured or doesn't integrate correctly with the Expo build process.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows several strategies to fix this: checking package versions, verifying configurations (app.json/expo.json), and reinstalling dependencies.  It highlights the importance of checking for warnings and errors in the console during the Expo CLI build process.
