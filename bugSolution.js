The solution involves systematically checking the common causes of Expo CLI errors:

1. **Verify `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies listed in `package.json` are correctly installed and compatible. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install or update them.
2. **Check `expo.json` or `app.json`:** Make sure the configuration files are valid JSON and contain no errors.  Pay close attention to any settings related to native modules or build processes.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files or temporary build artifacts interfere with the Expo CLI's functionality. Try cleaning the project's cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and then rebuilding. 
4. **Inspect Console Output:** Carefully examine the complete output of the Expo CLI command (especially warnings!).  It may hint at the root cause. 
5. **Check Native Module Integration:** If using any native modules, make sure they're properly configured and compatible with Expo's build system.  Verify that you have followed all the necessary integration steps.
6. **Reinstall Dependencies:** If other steps fail, try reinstalling all dependencies.  Sometimes package managers get into an inconsistent state. 
7. **Start a New Project:**  If none of the above works, start a fresh Expo project. Compare the files in the new project with your original one to see if you can identify any differences that are causing problems. This can help pinpoint configuration or structural inconsistencies in your existing project.
