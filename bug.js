This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has issues with its configuration or dependencies.  It's not a specific error message, but rather a symptom of underlying problems.  Debugging requires inspecting the project's structure, files, and package configurations.

For example, a mismatch between the project's `package.json` dependencies and the actual installed packages can trigger this.  Or, an incorrect configuration in `app.json` or `expo.json` (depending on the Expo project version) may lead to unexpected behavior and this generic error.  Furthermore, problems with native modules or build processes (especially related to Android or iOS) might also manifest as this cryptic error.
